====================================

quantlibapp is currently in alpha stage - if you find a bug, please submit an issue.


What is quantlibapp?
-----------

**quantlibapp** is a framework to use QuantLib-Python (version 1.12). Currently, 
one application is developed:

1. Calculate loan (annuity) schedule, similar to **numpy.pmt**, but this application
takes real date and consider UK holiday too. Those schedule is generated by QuantLib. 
Also the day counts are computed by Thirty360(Thirty360.USA).yearFraction

Please note that this version ONLY works on jupyterlab or jupyter notebook as it takes
input directly from the notebook. 

You can also try this on https://www.quantransform.co.uk/ but you will need to register
an account before you can do so.
